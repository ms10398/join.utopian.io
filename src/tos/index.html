                        9.1. You need not use a Utopian Account. If you wish to use an Account, you
                        must create an Account with Utopian to access the Services (“ Account”).
                        When you create an Account, you are strongly advised to take the following
                        precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or
                        control over, your Wallet: (a) Create a strong password that you do not use
                        for any other website or online service; (b) Provide accurate and truthful
                        information; (c) Maintain and promptly update your Account information; (d)
                        maintain the security of your Account by protecting your Account password

                        10. The Utopian Services
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things,
                        provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and
                        stores STEEM ACCOUNT Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below),
                        and (b) Facilitates the submission of STEEM transaction data to the Steem
                        network without requiring you to access the STEEM command line interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10.2. Account Names and Private Keys. When you create an Account, the
                        Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair
                        that you may use to send and receive STEEM and Steem Dollars via the Steem
                        network.. The Private Key uniquely matches the Account Name and must be
                        used in connection with the Account Name to authorize the transfer of STEEM
                        and Steem Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for
                        maintaining the security of your Private Key and any password phrase
                        associated with your wallet. You must keep your Account, password phrase
                        and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in
                        the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars associated with
                        the Wallet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10.3. No Password Retrieval. Utopian does not receive or store your Account
                        password, nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot
                        assist you with Account password retrieval. Our Services provide you with
                        tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing
                        you to set password hints, but the Services cannot generate a new password
                        for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account
                        password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account Names and
                        password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that
                        any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such
                        Account will become inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.

                    <p>
                        10.4. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Steem
                        transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger via
                        the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic network
                        that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled
                        or operated by Utopian. The Steem Network is operated by a decentralized
                        network of independent third parties. Blockchain has no control over the
                        Steem network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction
                        details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Steem
                        network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit
                        via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by
                        the Steem network. You may use the Services to submit these details to the
                        network.

                    <p>
                        10.5. No Storage or Transmission of STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.
                        Steem, in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an
                        intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership
                        record maintained in the Steem network. The Service does not store, send or
                        receive Steem. Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem
                        Dollars or Steem Power occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Steem
                        network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service
                        can effect the transfer of title or right in any Steem, Steem Dollars or
                        Steem Power.

                        Utopian being with respect to one another independent contractors.

                        information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You
                        accept and acknowledge that Utopian is not responsible for any errors or
                        omissions that you make in connection with any Steem transaction initiated
                        via the Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account Name or otherwise
                        provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your
                        transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been
                        submitted to the Steem network via the Services, The Services cannot assist
                        you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Utopian has no
                        control over the Steem Network and does not have the ability to facilitate
                        any cancellation or modification requests.

                        10.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes
                        apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction
                        details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit
                        the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Utopian is
                        not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem
                        transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any
                        taxes arising from any Steem transactions.

                        in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any
