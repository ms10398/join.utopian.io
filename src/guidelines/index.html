      <h3>Post Submission Guidelines</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Submission Content & Format</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Inclusion of any or all of the following may lead to a lower score of your submission:
          <ul>
            <li>Links to commercial products and affiliate links</li>
            <li>Requests for Steem / Steemit engagement (upvotes, resteems and follows)</li>
            <li>Tagging or mentioning other Steem / Utopian users without valid reason</li>
            <li>Including links to social profiles in a disruptive way</li>
            <li>Asking for Steem witness votes in a disruptive way</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To ensure contributions to Utopian are easy to read and understand, they should be written in a formal and professional style. Unprofessional, unclear, difficult to comprehend due to grammatical errors, or informally written submissions will
          receive a lower score or <b>may not be reviewed at all.</b> Please refer to the following resource when writing contribution submissions - <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/656/02/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/656/02/</a></li>
        <li>Only submissions in <b>easily understood English</b> will be reviewed and scored. Contributions in other languages must include a full and comprehensible translation of all content included in the submission.</li>
        <li>To increase reliability and allow for efficient reviewing, please use the submission templates provided for each category. Feel free to edit and expand upon the templates as long as the formatting is clear and all the information necessary for
          review is included.</li>
        <li>Images and videos used in contribution submissions should be of high resolution. Low resolution images and videos may lead to a lower score of your contribution.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Contribution Value, Volume and Detail</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to be considered for a reward, the contribution <b>must add value</b> to the Open Source project. Submissions that offer little to no added value to the project will not be eligible for potential reward.</li>
        <li>The submission should contain as much detail as necessary, describing the work done and (when possible) offering added value to readers.</li>
        <li>When applicable, graphical content like images, charts, videos and screenshots should be included.</li>
        <li>The length of the body of the contribution should be sufficient to provide a thorough overview of the submitted contribution.</li>
        <li>Texts should be structured using markdown to ensure readability. If you are not well familiar with Markdown or selected HTML tags to make your post look good, you can read more about it in <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Mastering Markdown</a>            on GitHub or in <a href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@espoem/make-your-posts-look-great-in-steemit-and-busy">this comprehensive guide</a> by @espoem.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Submission Originality</h4>
      <p>All submitted contributions <b>must be unique.</b> To ensure your submission is eligible for potential reward, please check if an identical or very similar contribution was previously submitted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duplicate submissions (by the same or different user) will not be eligible for potential reward.</li>
        <li>Content shared previously will not be considered for reward if a moderator discovers plagiarism, and the user submitting it <b>will be banned</b> from Utopian.</li>
        <li>All submissions must be a direct result of the contributor’s own work. Modifying the work/assets of others, or using a template while claiming it as fully original work will not be considered for reward, and the user submitting it <b>may be banned</b>            from Utopian.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Contribution Authorship</h4>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
        <li>To be eligible for potential reward, the submission post must include the information necessary to verify the identity of the contributor as the post author.</li>
        <li>If a contributor’s Steem / Utopian username does not match the username used in an external platform, they should either edit the username on the external platform, or provide alternative means of verification.</li>
        <li>Unless otherwise specified, every contributor should <b>only submit ONE</b> contribution post per task request. Use of multiple accounts to circumvent this rule will lead to <b>immediate ban</b> from Utopian services.</li>
      </ul>

        <h4>Task Request Submission Guidelines</h4>
        <p>Task requests are submitted by <b>Open Source project owners seeking contributions</b> to their project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submitted tasks should be explained in great detail and provide all the necessary details to actually be completed.</li>
          <li>Every Task Request Submission post should include one task request only. Submissions with multiple tasks requests will not be considered for reward or promotion.</li>
          <li>Task Request Submissions should be submitted to the category relevant to the type of request.</li>
          <li>Generic Task Request Submissions like "We are looking for contributors" will not be considered for reward or promotion.</li>
          <li>Task Request Submissions should include a means of communication for the contributor to contact the task publisher.</li>
          <li>Task Request Submissions should specify a deadline.</li>
          <li>Images, screenshots, links and examples should be included as part of the submission, when applicable.</li>
          <li>Project owners submitting a task request must remain available for inquiry. If no response or input from the project owner was received in 2 days, the submission will be scored as-is and may receive a lower score, thus reducing its chances
            of reward and/or promotion.</li>
